                    This week I created the github account for our shiny application. I also created the github for our website and I developed the website pages.
                    I added our group members as collaborators as well. Our group met and we went over what each of us is to work on for the upcoming week.

                   <p>
                      This week I did research on how to color in the map for top 100 counties as well as changing the dataframe in order to store the percentages in a new column. 
                      I also did on paper diagram of how the data should look and how the map show be shown on the app.  
                   </p>

                    <p>
                       This week i implemented the Daily AQI Pollutants line chart that displays all the pollutants for a specific year (if the data for that pollutant in a county is available for the requested year) that the user picks.

                     <p>
                        This week I fixed the tabs from project 1, and addded a new tab for project 2. I also changed some code for reading in the new files, now the 
                        files are are being read in much faster and thus the shiny.io page loads faster. I also created temporary template spots for every ones parts.
                        I am currently working on lowering the menu so that it is touchable on the AVL screen.

                  <p>
                     This week I implemented the stacked bar chart and table for each month of that year showing the number of days where the AQI was good / moderate / unhealthy for sensitive / unhealthy / very unhealthy / hazardous / unknown
                  </p>
                  <h3>Conrad</h3>
                   <p>
                      This week I made a tab for the map for part C, I got the top 100 for the pollutants map to work on a personal R project
                      However I could not get it to work for the Shiny app, will be trying to fix that. 
                   </p>
                   <h3>Mohammed</h3>
                    <p>
                       This week I continued working on the line chart as changing the template may have messed up the `Defining Parameter` so fixing the line chart so it behaves normally. Had grouping issues with the line charts fixed now!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Nicole</h3>
                     <p>
                        This week I lowered the sidebar menu items to be about 1/3 of the way down (about the top of the second screen in the EVL display) so that the touch display works for the shiny.io. 
                        Also readded the missing pollutants by year for all year table (this accidentally got deleted). Also created new areas for the bar plots and tables.

                     This week I added the code to be able to modify the colors on the tables. I also started creating scripts to clean the data files.

                      This week I got the map to display the top 100 counties for ozone, SO2, CO, NO2, PM2.5, PM10, and AQI. 
                   </p>
                   <h3>Mohammed</h3>
                    <p>
                       This week I worked on downloading the pollutants data and allowing the user to choose one of the 12 counties to pick from for 2018 which shows all the available options to pick from.

                     <p>
                        This week I have created a new skeleton for the map/table/bar chart for the part c pollutants and AQI of a year. I have also been fixing any errors that occur when someone adds their code 
                        to the main app.R file. Assisted Conrad with the map part of part C.

                     This week I finished the scripts to clean the data files. I cleaned the data and uploaded them to github. I also created a script to get all the state and county codes that correspond to the state and county names I then created a state code and county code to state name and county name function.
                     I also added code to read the corresponding files correctly.

                   <p>
                      This week I Implemented the slider so that the users can pick the number of counties that user can see in the map as well as changing the color so that color blind people can see the “badness” as countries pollution gets worst.  
                   </p>
                   <h3>Mohammed</h3>
                    <p>
                       This week I used those 12 counties data for 2018 and created a bar chart that goes across the shiny dashboard and displays all the available data for that specific year. Also, added the pick a date function so the user can see which dates have data and also gave the option to see all or part of the pollutants by using a check mark to mark which ones are requested to see. Then created stacked lines on the same line chart to show how the data changes hourly for that chosen date.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Nicole</h3>
                     <p>
                        This week I Uploaded the files to the server. Change the colors to the charts so that people with protanomaly, deuteranomaly, tritanomaly, and dichromacy can see it. Help Conrad with adding a slider to the bottom of the screen.
